HomeView.swift -> DealsApp HomeView modified using NavigationStack
(I tried using .navigationDestination but it broke the app, so I tried to add as much
NavigationStack stuff as I could without breaking the display)

StocksApp -> StocksApp project with View Model tests implemented for API
Uses async throws calls for API calling and tests are modified for that
Tests for successful and failed calls to API
Includes stocksGood.json and stocksBad.json for mock service calls
